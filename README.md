# Pygame Text Editor
This is a text editor made in pygame and was submitted to the Cambridge Press as part of a competition. You can find an executable to run the program at `New Final Version/Compiled Version/run.exe` in 2015. Its a good example of the concept that just because a solution is complicated, doesn't make it better.
