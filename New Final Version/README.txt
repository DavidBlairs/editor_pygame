Text Analysis Program By David Blair
=====================================
Please read all of this before opening any programs or PowerPoints.

	This is the README.txt file for my text analysis program. It along with the python code in which the program was written 
and the compiled version of the program are kept along side this file. This file contains the details you requested in the
competition post and a recommended procedure of how you might go about "investigating" my code and the program I have 
written.



-------Personal Details-------

Name of Participating Student = David Blair
Computer Science Teacher = Michael Fielding (Mr Fielding)
School = Chatham Grammar School For Boys 
Address of School = Holcombe, Maidstone Road, Chatham ME4 6JB



-------Recommended Procedure of Investigation------

Step 1: Understanding How to Use the Program
	recommend you first go through my PowerPoint which details the majority of the features of my program and takes you through 
a step by step guide on how to use my program to search for a selection of keywords ( ‘fear’, ‘terror’, ‘threat’, ‘the enemy’,
‘out there’, ‘always’, ‘circling’, ‘watching’, ‘waiting’). You can search virtually anything you like really as these words 
are only examples. 
	The tutorial begins on page 20 if you want to begin there or if you want you could read the entire PowerPoint to get a better
knowledge on the program your investigating. 


Step 2: Using the Program
	I have included the raw code for the program but I doubt you will have pygame installed to be able to run the program
and even if you did, There is a high chance it won't run. In light of this, I have also included a compiled exe of the program to 
increase the likelyhood of the program being able to run on your computer. If it doesn't, there are plenty of screenshots and videos
in the PowerPoint that you could make some sort of judgement on. 




-----Location of All FIles------
Main python file to run the code = "The Code\run.py"
python file for handling the Text Editor = "The Code\textEditor.py"
python file for handling the Control Panel = "The Code\controlPanel.py"
python file which contains some functions for surface manipulation = "The Code\surfaceManipulation.py"
python file which contains some functions regarding complex keyboard events in the Text Editor = "The Code\complexEvents.py"
python file which has some GUI display surfaces to allow all the modules to use them = "The Code\displayConstants.py"

Exe which can and should be run to display the program = "Compiled Version\run.exe"
